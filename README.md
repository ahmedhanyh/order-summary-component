## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM class naming methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I think there's a better way to set the height of an image or a div with a background image more appropriately. More to learn about that.

### Useful resources

- [Background CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - It helps to be aware of the different background properties.
